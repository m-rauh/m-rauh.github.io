<p>Before breaking down what is Hash and how to implement it, letâ€™s understand where itâ€™s applicable and why.</p>

<p>Imagine youâ€™ve arrived at a city with a mission of delivering a package to a person named Dave Davies. You have no prior knowledge of where he lives or any information that could help you find where to delivery the package. Your only option would be knock on every door of every apartment of every building, until you find Dave Davies. If that sounds harsh, you can picture how this task would be nearly impossible in cities with millions of people such as SÃ£o Paulo, Jakarta, New York or Tokyo.</p>

<p>Even if you had a list with each personâ€™s name and their adresses, you would still have to search for Dave in this list among millions of other names. A computer faces a similiar problem when retrieving info from large databases.</p>

<p><em>Hash</em> helps getting around this. Imagine instead, with only a personâ€™s name you could do a mathematical manipulation and arrive at this personâ€™s address. No matter who, you would be able to use the same mathematical function. Thatâ€™s the proposal of a <em>hash</em>, going straight to the infoâ€™s source without having to search for it.</p>

<p>Of course, thatâ€™s not the only porpouse. It could be used to retrieve and join information faster, to quicly match an input with a database (for example biometric entry systems), to make a search mechanism and more.</p>
